Corba Speed improvements

Original had about 230ms average time, wanted to improve, did the following
1) checks for corbaImpl already being defined, since it is static. Improved to about 40ms averages, up from 200+ms

Further improvements: 
Move connection into the CorbaClient class and have CorbaClientThread use that connection, avoids creating new handles constantly. 
This should result in even more drastic speed ups
